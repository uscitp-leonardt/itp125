WHAT IS THE OLD SPICE PYTHON PROJECT?
------------------------------------------
- The Old Spice Python Project is a program that takes user inputs and choices to create a custom voicemail.

- Users can specify things like their gender, their number, and their reasons for not being able to answer
  their phone. It is possible to specify these options from command line arguments or by running the program.


GENERAL USAGE NOTES
------------------------------------------
- The program was written using Python 2 and the commands work according to that version of python.
  For example, "raw_input" versus "input" works only in Python 2. Please use accordingly to avoid errors.

- After taking in user inputs and choices, the program matches the user choices to a corresponding mp3
  on an external server, downloads the mp3, compiles and then splices them together.
